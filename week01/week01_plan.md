0. Set up your machine with the recommended development tools. 

	We recommend that you do this in pairs during class night or during office hours.

	0. Install the package manager for your OS. For OSX, we recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). There's a [introductory screencast available](http://screencasts.org/episodes/how-to-use-homebrew) *Note: You don't have to use our recommended tools. However, the rest of the course assumes the use of recommended tools.*

	0. Install git. (Optional: install a git GUI client. We'll discuss which one in class.)

	0. Install [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com). Get version 3 if you are feeling adventurous. This is a paid software product that has an indefinite free trial. You should plan on paying for it as soon as you have a developer job.

0. Connect up to the community

	0. Install an IRC client and visit the #portlandcodeschool channel on irc.freenode.net. Say hi to "Auraelius" (Al).
	0. Join the Google+ "Portland Code School" Community. If you didn't get an invitation, contact Al or Cris Kelly.
	0. Add your contact information to the Google doc student list. If you didn't get an invitation, contact Cris Kelly.
	0. Join Cel.ly and join the "Portland Code School" and "Front End Freelancer" groups. This will help you hear about school closures and makes aranging meetups and employer visits easy and fun.

0. Prepare a Lightning talk for the second class. This is a 5 minute talk about anything that means something to you. Your goal is to teach the class something new. Any topic is OK, you just need to care about what you are teaching us. 



## Community Activity

We encourage all students to participate in the local technical community. 

????

### Community online tools

#### Mailing lists (Google Groups)

Join these lists!

????

#### Google Community
As part of something new, we are establishing a Google+ "Community" just for Portland Code School. We'd appreciate your participation to see if this is something worthwhile. Unlike FaceBook, Google+ is used by technology professionals to network.

#### Realtime video & desktop sharing: Hangouts, Skype
* Google+ Hangouts - Multiway video and desktop sharing
* Skype - 1 on 1 video and desktop sharing.

There's aren't any regularly scheduled hangouts, yet, so contact the person you want to connect with ahead of time.

#### Realtime chat: IRC
Many developers and all sorts of other people hang out on IRC. It's great for semi-anonymous, real-time communication. Many gems and other applications have IRC channels where the authors are willing to answer questions. It's really a developer's paradise.

There are several command-line clients worth investigating. On the Mac, Colloqy (http://colloquy.info) is a good choice while Adium (https://adium.im) is a great multi-modal chat client.

Portland Code School has a student channel on irc.freenode.net called "#portlandcodeschool" that you should check out. Instructors and former students also hangout there.


Like any group or society, IRC has its own norms of interaction. As with any communication situation, it's worth your time to learn how to behave "when in Rome." For an introduction on IRC, see http://www.ircbeginner.com
