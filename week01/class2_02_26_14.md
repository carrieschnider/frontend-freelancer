####Integrating Website design and scrolling:
eg: snowfall effect - a popular UX pattern

####Kitchen Metaphor for Understanding Web Servers and Division of Tasks:
Start with the Raw Materials

How to prepare?

What to prepare?

Things that happen in the kitchen (or the back end) to prepare for the loading of the page


UX would be what happens to the customer the instant they walk in the door including:

* menus
* architecture
* service


#####Browser Side (Client):
* Markup 

* CSS

* Javascript

**HTTP request communicates between the browser and server**

#####Server Side (kitchen):

* Server
* Database
* Static Site Generators
* Web app
* Template
* CMS - Content Management System like Wordpress

We will focus on the front end or the browser side of a html page

####The Web Server:
**MAMP** - Mac Apache MySQL PHP

Apache is web server HTTP talks to a web app

Middleman is another example of a web server

**HTTP**:  Hyper text transfer protocol

Web apps use templates to take data from data store and pushes it to the browser.

Static pages do not change and might also be served up by the web server

We will start with static pages and then use templates.

**API** - Advanced Programming Interface


####Island Metaphor for the Command Line and Bash:
At the bottom of every computer is the Command Line Interface (CLI)
Patterns and expectations for interacting with CLI

On a mac, open up terminal. Here are some common unix commands
**~/**	 	Home directory
**pwd**		Print working directory
**cd**  	Change directory
**/** 		Path separator
**ls**  	List directory contents
**rm** 		Remove a file
**mkdir**	Make directory

**ls -alF**  show all files in the long form and the folders

To find help about unix commands:
man ls - will give you the help for a command for the ls command. ex. **man [command]**


There are a lot of helpful unix cheat sheets and here is one:

Here is another one:

**BASH** - Bourne Again Shell

Affordance is what a machine invites you to do with it.

Every command is word and takes options and arguments.

####Git Arguments:
Finding help on Git:	**git help**

Git Status:		**git status**

Ask git for help on a particular sub command for example: git help status

Never put a repository in a repository.

A helpful diagram for thinking about Git is:

* shell or local changes
* staging area
* repository
*to share the work, push it to the Github repository (origin)

If we are building off existing work, we often start by cloning the repository


**git clone**		To clone a git repository


The smallest change creates a working copy of the file in shell.  When you have finished with the changes, add the files to the repository.


**git add**			Adds a files with changes to the staging area

A commit collects the files that have been added.  A commit is meaningful piece of work

**git commit -m**	Commits the changes to the repository

After you have committed the changes to your local branch, if you want to push your commits to Github use:

**git push**

To pull updated files from Github into an existing repository:

**git pull**

Besides the online videos, a useful git resource is the Git Pro pdf which can be found here:

####Generating Secure Encryption Keys:
Web encryption happens by exchanging keys which Github requires
**SSH** 	 - Secure Shell
**HTTPS** - HTTP Secure

In order to use the encryption you have to generate the secure shell keys.  Here is the page:
